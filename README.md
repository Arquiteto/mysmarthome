# My Smart Home project
HomeAssistant configs, ESPhome configs, MikroTik configs.

## ESPHome configs I made
- Xiaomi Mi Desk Lamp (ESP82xx based)
- SonOff iFAN03 (with/without buzzer implemented) - place the "ifan03.h" file in the main ESPhome directory
- SonOff Mini (custom config with external LED as relay status)
## MikroTik
- TBD
